Team ITS decided to produce a desktop client for the Signal Messaging application. Our goal was to produce a basic GUI client to allow users to communicate using the Signal servers. Over the years there have been requests in the Signal community to create a Desktop application. We felt this was a good opportunity for us to take on a larger project, and to improve the Signal community.
&nbsp;
This project provided a wide range of experiences for the team. From basic GUI programming and event handling, to the use of JSON objects and manipulation. We attempted to leverage Agile principles to organize our work, seeking to minimize the batch size and allow for better collaboration.
&nbsp;
For the most part the team members gravitated to areas of the project that were either interesting to them, or matched their skill sets. In the end half the team worked on the GUI interface, and implementation while the rest implemented the underlying logic.
My role centered around the interface to the Signal libraries, allowing us to communicate with the server and store persistent data. I also worked on mapping the object lifecycle, and looking at the overall interface to the GUI.
&nbsp;
Overall, as a team I think we worked well together. We had a rather short timeline to produce the application. This coupled with other assignments related to this project, and timing of Holidays significantly reduced the time that the team had to contribute to the project. While our use of Agile practices helped to measure and assess team productivity, I donâ€™t think most of the team had enough previous experience for it to really shine in the end.
&nbsp;
The most challenging area of the project was encouraging the team to produce stub code and tests. Most of the team was very centered on producing fully functioning features, not functional units. In the end most of the development of the GUI was deferred until the backend was producing data, leaving a large amount of integration work to be done at the very end.
&nbsp;
Overall, thanks to the whole team being willing to come together when deadlines approached. We were able to produce an application that met our original goals. There is a lot of room to improve upon, and add further functionality. I hope in the end, at least some of the team, is able to continue development and produce a polished final product.
